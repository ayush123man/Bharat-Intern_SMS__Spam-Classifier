# Bharat-Intern,SMS__Spam-Classifier
The "SMS Spam Classifier" project is designed to create a smart system that can distinguish between spam and legitimate text messages. It does this by using advanced computer techniques to understand the language of the messages. By doing this, it helps users avoid unwanted or potentially harmful messages, making their communication experience safer and more efficient.

To start, the project loads a dataset containing both spam and non-spam messages and prepares it for analysis. It converts the labels indicating whether a message is spam or not into a format that the computer can understand for training purposes. Then, it transforms the text of the messages into numbers, which allows the computer to analyze them effectively.

Next, the project trains a model using a technique called Multinomial Naive Bayes, which is a method commonly used in machine learning. This model learns from the numerical representations of the messages and can make predictions about whether new messages are spam or not.

The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, which measures how often the model correctly identifies spam and non-spam messages. Additionally, users can input their own messages to see if the model identifies them as spam or not in real-time, providing immediate feedback.

Overall, this project provides a useful tool for filtering out spam messages in various communication platforms, making it safer and more enjoyable for users to communicate without being bothered by unwanted messages.
